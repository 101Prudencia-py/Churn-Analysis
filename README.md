# SYRIATEL Churn-Analysis
Churn Analysis on SyriaTel,  a telecommunications company

# Overview
Syriatel is one of the major telecommunications companies in Syria, providing a range of services including mobile and fixed-line telephony, internet, and other related services. Conducting a churn analysis for Syriatel involves examining customer behaviors and patterns to predict which customers are likely to discontinue their services with the company.

This project uses the syriatel dataset to conduct a comprehensive analysis of churn predictions using various models such as logistic regression , Decison trees classifier and random forest classifier as it is a binary classification problem.

We seek to gather insights that can help syriatel predict which customers are most likely to leave and stay and what factors cause or instigate this decision.

# Business Understanding
Our main objective is to build a model that can accurately predict when a customer is about to leave by analysisng the behaviors and trends that precede churn. Identify indicators or triggers indicating a higher likelihood of churn.

To identify which features are correlated to churn.

How can we keep our customer base to reduce churn whule also attracting new customers.

To the stakeholder which is SyriaTel. We are interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long and take precautions.

# Data Understanding
The dataset contains information about syriaTel customers and is in a csv file format. Some features included in the data are minutes clients have used, state the customer is in , their area code , how many day/evening/international calls they have made, the number of times a customer has called customer service and if they have churned. Our target variable is Churn. The dataset contains 3333 rows and 21 columns. As the analysis progresses, some rows may be dropped such as phone number as they aren't useful when modelling.
